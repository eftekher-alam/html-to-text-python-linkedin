                    the
                    console? What does
                    this
                    code print to the console? 




let animals = [{ type: "lion" },
                            "tiger"];
                            let clones = animals.slice();

                            clones[0].type = "bear";
                            clones[1] = "sheep";

                            console.log(animals[0].type, clones[0].type);
                            console.log(animals[1], clones[1]); let animals = [{ type: "lion" }, "tiger"];
                            let clones = animals.slice();

                            clones[0].type = "bear";
